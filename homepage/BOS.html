.  .  .  No,  unquestionably  this  is  not — more  geome- 
trico — the  best  way  of  beginning  my  story.  To 
claim  that  it  is  true  is  nowadays  the  convention  of 
every  made-up  story.  Mine,  however,  is  true. </p>

<p>I  live  alone  in  a  fourth-floor  apartment  on  Bel- 
grano  Street,  in  Buenos  Aires.  Late  one  evening,  a 
few  months  back,  I  heard  a  knock  at  my  door.  I 
opened  it  and  a  stranger  stood  there.  He  was  a  tall 
man,  with  nondescript  features — or  perhaps  it  was 
my  myopia  that  made  them  seem  that  way. 
Dressed  in  gray  and  carrying  a  gray  suitcase  in  his 
hand,  he  had  an  unassuming  look  about  him.  I 
saw  at  once  that  he  was  a  foreigner.  At  first,  he 
struck  me  as  old;  only  later  did  I  realize  that  I  had 
been  misled  by  his  thin  blond  hair,  which  was,  in  a 
Scandinavian  sort  of  way,  almost  white.  During  the 
course  of  our  conversation,  which  was  not  to  last 
an  hour,  I  found  out  that  he  came  from  the  Ork- 
neys. </p>  

<p>I  invited  him  in,  pointing  to  a  chair.  He  paused 
awhile  before  speaking.  A  kind  of  gloom  ema- 
nated from  him — as  it  does  now  from  me. 

"I  sell  Bibles,"  he  said. 

Somewhat  pedantically,  I  replied,  "In  this  house 
are  several  English  Bibles,  including  the  first — 
John  Wiclif's.  I  also  have  Cipriano  de  Valera's, 
Luther's — which,  from  a  literary  viewpoint,  is  the 
worst — and  a  Latin  copy  of  the  Vulgate.  As  you 
see,  it's  not  exactly  Bibles  I  stand  in  need  of." </p>

<p> After  a  few  moments  of  silence,  he  said,  "I  don't 
only  sell  Bibles.  I  can  show  you  a  holy  book  I  came 
across  on  the  outskirts  of  Bikaner.  It  may  interest 
you." 

He  opened  the  suitcase  and  laid  the  book  on  a 
table.  It  was  an  octavo  volume,  bound  in  cloth. 
There  was  no  doubt  that  it  had  passed  through 
many  hands.  Examining  it,  I  was  surprised  by  its 
unusual  weight.  On  the  spine  were  the  words 
"Holy  Writ"  and,  below  them,  "Bombay." </p>

<p> "Nineteenth  century,  probably,"  I  remarked. 

"I  don't  know,"  he  said.  "I've  never  found  out." 

I  opened  the  book  at  random.  The  script  was 
strange  to  me.  The  pages,  which  were  worn  and 
typographically  poor,  were  laid  out  in  double  col- 
umns, as  in  a  Bible.  The  text  was  closely  printed, 
and  it  was  ordered  in  versicles.  In  the  upper 
corners  of  the  pages  were  Arabic  numbers.  I  no- 
ticed that  one  left-hand  page  bore  the  number  (let 
us  say)  40,514  and  the  facing  right-hand  page  999. 
I  turned  the  leaf;  it  was  numbered  with  eight 
digits.  It  also  bore  a  small  illustration,  like  the  kind 
used  in  dictionaries — an  anchor  drawn  with  pen 
and  ink,  as  if  by  a  schoolboy's  clumsy  hand. 

It  was  at  this  point  that  the  stranger  said,  "Look </p>
